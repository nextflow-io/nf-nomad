== Configuration

Most of the basic configuration is in a `nomad` closure in the `nextflow.config` file

i.e.

```
nomad{
    client{
        address = "http://localhost:4646"
    }
    jobs{
        deleteoncompletion = false
    }
}
```

=== Client configuration

- address, a URL
- token, if the cluster is protected you must to provide a token

=== Jobs configuration

- deleteOnCompletion, a boolean indicating if the job will be removed once completed
