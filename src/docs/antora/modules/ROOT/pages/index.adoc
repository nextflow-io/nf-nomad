== Introduction

The aim of this plugin is to integrate `Nextflow` and Hashicorp `Nomad` executor for batch processing of jobs.

The plugin itself is similar in design and scope to other executor integrations such as `nf-azure` and `k8s`, however as `Nomad` (arguably) offers a simpler setup, we aimed to address the usability of a Nomad cluster within the Nextflow ecosystem.

Hope you enjoy using the plugin and please participate in the development/feedback of the plugin in the `platform-nomad` channel on the Nextflow Slack instance. We would love to hear your feedback!
